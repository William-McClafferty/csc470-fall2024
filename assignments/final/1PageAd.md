Embark on an epic journey as the Egyptian Knight, to rescue the princess from the clutches of the Egyptian deity, Anubis. My game, steeped in the rich lore and mystique of ancient Egypt, takes players through three challenging levels designed to test their courage, skill, and determination.


The adventure begins in the vast and unforgiving desert. Here, players must navigate across the river using wooden planks to then get to the maze and reach the Great Pyramid. This level sets the stage for the Egyptian Knight’s perilous journey. It gives a warm welcome to the player.


The second level challenges players to ascend the towering pyramid. Once you reached the end of the last level, you saw the pyramid was locked. You need to climb up the pyramid and reach the hole to drop through the bottom. Each step closer to the summit is ridden with obstacles. From moving platforms, to wooden beams. The climb symbolizes the Knight’s unwavering resolve, pushing players to adapt and strategize as they ascend to the top.


The final stage takes place deep within the Great Pyramid in Anubis’ temple, where players must navigate the corridors and solve ancient platforming challenges. When you get to the end, consider yourself a winner!


I have always been inspired by the myths and legends of Ancient Egypt in old video games I used to play, so I’m glad I can emphasize this here in my game. I chose ancient Egypt as the setting because of its unique aesthetic and timeless appeal. The blend of mystery, danger adds an immersive quality to the gameplay. It makes each level feel like a journey into a lost world.


“The Egyptian Rescue” is more than just a game; it is an homage to the platforming genre and a celebration of one of history’s most fascinating civilizations. I hope players find the experience as thrilling and memorable as I found creating it. I’ve included screenshots of gameplay below.
